        <h3>Black Pepper Cultivating States in India:-</h3>
        <p>Kerala, TamilNadu, Karnataka, Konkan region,
            Pondicherry & Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="two">
        <h3>Climate Required for Black Pepper Farming:-</h3>
        <p>Black pepper thrives best in tropical hot and humid
            climatic conditions. It requires about 200 cm of annual rainfall. The ideal temperature for its successful
            growth is between 10°C and 40°C. This spice can be successfully cultivated at 1400 m above sea level
            (msl).A dry spell of at least a month before flowering is needed for fruit set.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="three">
        <h3>Soil Requirement for Black Pepper Farming:- </h3>
        <p>Black pepper can be cultivated on wide variety of soils
            like red loam, clay loam and sandy loam soils. However, Virgin soils rich in humus (organic matter)
            content and well drained are ideal for black pepper cultivation. For better yield, soil should have pH
            value of 5.0 – 6.5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="four">
        <h3>Propagation in Black Pepper Farming:- </h3>
        <p>In commercial black pepper farming, generally Black pepper propagation is done by vegetatively (by cuttings).
             However it can also propagated by seeds, as this process takes so long, It is not preferred method for
              commercial cultivation. In vegetative method of propagation, pepper cuttings with 2-3 nodes are made from vines
               are put bamboo basket (filled with soil) or raised in plastic bags during the month of March-April. These 
               pepper cuttings will be ready for transplanting in the main field in about 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="five">
        <h3>Planting Method in Black Pepper Farming:-</h3>
        <p>Due to its climbing nature, black pepper plant needs
            some kind of support. In monocrop, the support might be a tree or any fixed pole (Standard).However,
            if you have trees in your field, these can be used as standard or support. Black pepper plants should be
            planted @ a distance of 3 to 4 m. Due to its climbing nature; pepper plant needs some kind of support.
            The support might be a tree or any fixed pole (Standard).However, If you have trees in your field, these
            can be used as standard or support. Black pepper plants should be planted @ a distance of 3 to 4 m.
            Pits with size of 0.5 m x 0.5 m x 0.5 m should be dug @ a distance of 25 to 30 cm away from support
            (standard). Just before monsoon starts, 2 to 3 rooted tree cuttings should be planted in the pits made
            in soil. Make sure at least 1 node of the plant cutting will go to underground and remaining should be
            40 to 45 cm above ground level. Fill the pits with soil and 10 kg of well rotten manure (cow dung).In the
            initial stages, covering the plants with shade would be beneficial. Pits with size of 0.5 m x 0.5 m x 0.5 m
            should be dug @ a distance of 25 to 30 cm away from support (standard). Just before monsoon starts, 2
            to 3 rooted tree cuttings should be planted in the pits made in soil. Make sure at least 1 node of the
            plant cutting will go to underground and remaining should be 40 to 45 cm above ground level. Fill the

            in cluster shows scarlet red colour. Black pepper berries will be ready for picking 6 months to 7 months
            of planting in the main field. Spikes can be harvested when almost 90 % of berries become matured.
            Usually harvesting starts from Nov and continues up to March month. Usually hand picking should be
            carried out.
